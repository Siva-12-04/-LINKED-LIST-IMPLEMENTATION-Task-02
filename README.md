DURATION : FEBRUARY 5th, 2025 to MARCH 5th, 2025 (4 WEEKS)

MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH

OBJECTIVE:

The primary objective of the provided C program is to implement a simple singly linked list data structure and demonstrate basic operations that can be performed on it. The program allows users to:

Insert Nodes: Add new nodes to the linked list either at the beginning or at the end.

Delete Nodes: Remove nodes from the linked list based on a specified value.

Display the List: Traverse and print the contents of the linked list in a readable format.

Memory Management: Properly free allocated memory to prevent memory leaks when the program exits.

This program serves as an educational tool for understanding linked lists, dynamic memory allocation, and basic data structure manipulation in C programming.

CONCLUSION:

In conclusion, the program effectively demonstrates the following key concepts:

Dynamic Data Structures: The linked list is a dynamic data structure that allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes without the need for contiguous memory allocation, unlike arrays.

Memory Management: The program emphasizes the importance of managing memory in C, including allocating memory for new nodes and freeing it when nodes are deleted or when the program exits.

User Interaction: The menu-driven interface provides a simple way for users to interact with the linked list, making it easy to understand how different operations affect the structure.

Error Handling: The program includes basic error handling, such as checking for memory allocation failures and handling cases where a node to be deleted does not exist.

Educational Value: This implementation serves as a foundational example for students and programmers to learn about linked lists and their operations, which are fundamental concepts in computer science and programming.
